# Stream Deck Animated Screensaver

This project allows you to create an animated wallpaper that you can set up on your Elgato Stream Deck as a preset, and switch to it using a button. This is the same as the paid screensavers that you can get on the Elgato marketplace, but you can use your own videos with this project.

## Usage

### Linux/macOS

Install Homebrew, then run these commands:

```sh
brew install ffmpeg 7z git
git clone https://github.com/illixion/StreamDeck-Animated-Screensaver.git
cd StreamDeck-Animated-Screensaver
./elgatoscreensaver.sh /path/to/video.mp4
```

### Windows

Set up WSL and install Ubuntu from the Windows Store, then once it's set up, run these commands:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg p7zip-full git
git clone https://github.com/illixion/StreamDeck-Animated-Screensaver.git
cd StreamDeck-Animated-Screensaver
./elgatoscreensaver.sh /mnt/c/Users/User/Desktop/video.mp4
```

The resulting preset file will be saved in the same folder as the script, which you can then open using the Elgato Stream Deck software, and assign a "Switch Profile" action to switch to the screensaver.
